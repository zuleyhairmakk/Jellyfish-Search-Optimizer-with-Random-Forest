Jellyfish Search(JS) optimizer is metaheuristic algorithm that is motivated by search behaivor of jellyfish involves their following the ocean current, their motions inside a jellyfish swarm(active motions and passive motions).In this project we use Jellyfish search optimizer algorithm to optimize Random Forest parameter that observe F-measure Score.We also compare the output of the F-measure with Jellyfish optimizer and without Jellyfish optimizer
